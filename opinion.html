	<h1>Flop of IPL</h1>
	Definitely no. which can be seen by empty stadiums.<br><br>One reason is "failed ipl fantasy league" lot of people are used to play fanatsy leagues and support their players which is not the case this year.<br> <br>Second reason is "No home state players" because of this crowd didn't know which player to support for. <br><br>Third reason " elimination of CSK" no doubt CSK is the best team ofipl and was responsible for publicity of ipl.
